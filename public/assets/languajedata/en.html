                    <p> Where you can buy a single pack to have all the cards corresponding to that pack, because learning does not come from repeated purchase of the same book, but from repeated reading of the same and other books. </p>

                    <p> In order to show the modus operandi, and daily life of a philosopher, we try to make the form of duels close to a contest in which the fray is given by means of eristics, or the fight with words. Our cards are therefore representations of philosophical concepts (to a greater or lesser extent) </p>

                    <h3> Ludification of philosophical knowledge </h3>
                    <p> With our game we approach, in a mechanical way, some relations between philosophical concepts of real life, all in order to understand, in an entertaining way, how the thought of the different philosophers is structured. As a good form of gamification and gamification, you learn by playing, maybe it won't help you to get your PhD, but at least you'll be able to have a bar conversation with the drunkard on duty and not feel overwhelmed by what he says. </p>

Replicas are cards that serve as a response to the concepts, so that the player who played the concept can jump in with another concept, simulating a change of theme, or a counter-reply. Generally speaking, the counter-replica is a more powerful card than the concept. </p><p><img src="http://localhost:8080/assets/img/assets_cartas/paper_shadow.png" width="50px" height="50px"> There are currently only 3 effects associated with the card, the first one is search that gives you cards according to the description, draw that makes you draw as many cards as it appears in the description, reference of another card in which if it is not there, you can't play it even if you have the cost or time to play it.
